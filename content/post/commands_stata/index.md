* ***wbopendata***: Download data from World Bank directly from STATA.

* ***tokenize***: Divide strings into tokens

* ***grc1leg2***: Add a common legend to combined graphs (findit grc1leg2). 

* ***texdoc***: Latex tables directly on STATA. Longer (but worth it) way to get results into latex tables directly from STATA. 

* ***sendtoslack***: Send message to inform the code finished. Very helpful when working with large administrative data. 

* ***codebook***: Command to describe data.

* ***levelsof***: local(macroname): transforms values of a string into local macros
